# Odin Project #26: Blog API (frontend)

The goal of this Odin Project assignment was to create a full-stack blog application. This repo contains the front-end that was built with React. The admin can add posts and manage users, posts and comments. Guests can browse posts and read comments left by others. The user can also add comments to posts but they need to have an account to do that. Ideally there should be two separate front-ends, one for the user and one for the administrator, however I settled on just one for simplicity reasons. I decided to give Tailwind a try and it's pretty good so far. I avoided it earlier due to ugly syntax. 

The back-end was built with Express (and other tools) and can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/brightneon7631/odin-blog-api-backend).

I started and finished this project in September 2024.

## Assignment

[The Odin Project - NodeJS - #26 Blog API](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-nodejs-blog-api)

## Technology

- JavaScript
- React
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- Axios
- JWT decode

### Additional NPM packages
- date-fns
- react-icons

## Key Concepts

- Single-page apps
- Client-side routing
- BrowserRouter & Routes: createBrowserRouter(), createRoutesFromElements() & RouterProvider
- Route, path & element
- Layout Route & Outlet
- Protected routes
- Link & NavLink: navigation, active styling, state & useLocation()
- JWT Decode: decoding JWT tokens client-side (validation of course takes place server-side)
- Consuming REST APIs in React: fetch vs axios, setting the authorization header, performing requests, handling errors, updating state
- useEffect: side effects, syntax, dependencies array, async functions, fetching data from the API, Local Storage
- Context: useContext, createContext, context provider, passing values

## Features
